# GAN

In this repository, I will maintain a separate notebook for each GAN experiments I will do. Each notebook will be self sufficient. I will use the MNIST dataset as the baseline for testing of different version of GAN. So far I have experimented the following GAN architectures.

1. [Vanilla GAN](https://github.com/abhishm/gan/blob/master/Vanilla%20GAN.ipynb)   
2. [Conditional Vanilla GAN](https://github.com/abhishm/gan/blob/master/Conditional_Vanilla_GAN.ipynb)
